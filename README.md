Assignment 5
1) Use Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm to create the Minimum Spanning Tree for the graph provided.
2) Determine how Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm detect cycle in a graph and also show what happens when Kruskal's algorithm is    used with Prim's algorithm's cycle detection method.
3) Determine the effects of using Kruskal's and Prim's algorithm for drected graph in comparison to the undirected graph.
4) Using the code provided by the slides highlight the difference between Naive Prim's and Eager Prim's algorithms.
5) Using the three conditions provided, figure out if the graph is still a Minimum Spanning Tree.
6) Create a trace for the graph using the three algorithms: Bellman Ford Algorithm, Djikstra's Algorithm, Topological Sort        Algorithm.
7) Understand why directed acryclic graph is needed in order to carry out Topological Sort Algorithm.
8) Explain why Djikstra's Algorithm doesn't require a cycle detection.
9) Explain why Djikstra's Algorithm cannot be performed if there are negative edge weights.
10) Find the maximum flow of the graph below using the Ford Fulkerson Algorithm.
